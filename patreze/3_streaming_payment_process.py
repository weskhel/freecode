# Streaming Payments Processor
#
# The function `process_payments()` is processing a large, but finite
# amount of payments in a streaming fashion.
#
# It relies on two library functions to do its job. The first function
# `stream_payments_to_storage(storage)` reads the payments from a payment
# processor and writes them to storage by calling `storage.write(buffer)`
# on it's `storage` argument. The `storage` argument is supplied by
# calling `get_payments_storage()` function. The API is defined below.
#
# TODO: Modify `process_payments()` to print a checksum of bytes written
# by `stream_payments_to_storage()`. The existing functionality
# should be preserved.
#
# The checksum is implemented as a simple arithmetic sum of bytes.
#
# For example, if bytes([1, 2, 3]) were written, you should print 6.
#
#
# NOTE: you need to take into account the following restrictions:
# - You are allowed only one call each to `get_payments_storage()` and
#       to `stream_payments_to_storage()`
# - You can not read from the storage.
# - You can not use disk as temporary storage.
# - Your system has limited memory that can not hold all payments.
